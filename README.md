####BattleShip x86_64 MASM Format
This is the board game Battleship in x86_64 assembly(MASM FORMAT).
You will need the Irvine 32 Libary to run this.
This is in MASM format, it has been tested in Windows only. Tests have been successful in Windows 7 x32,x64 Windows 8 & 8.1 x32 x64!!

I will imrove this game in the future, for now a working copy will do.
I used Visual Studio 2013 Free Edition to assemble and run the code.
You may also need 2012 Build Tools to run this successfully! This is important!

```
