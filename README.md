#BattleShip x86_64 MASM Format
This is the board game Battleship in x86_64 assembly(MASM FORMAT).
####- Made by Hector Vargas.

You will need the Irvine 32 Libary to run this, which is located [here.](http://www.kipirvine.com/asm/examples/)
This is in MASM format, it has been tested in Windows only. Tests have been successful in Windows 7 x32,x64 Windows 8 & 8.1 x32 x64!!

I will improve this game in the future, for now a working copy will do.
I used Visual Studio 2013 Free Edition to assemble and run the code.
You may also need 2012 Build Tools to run this successfully! These can be found [here.](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38807)
